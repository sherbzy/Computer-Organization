1. Group Name: Motyga Hackathon
   Members: Lauren Sherburne, Lucas King, Thomas Jensen
   Course: CSCI 341 - Computer Organization
   Midterm 1 - Part 2 - Unhacked!
   Date: 10/6/20

2. Total Time: 4 hours

3. The first thing our group did was talk through the hack.s file that we were given to determine its purpose. We added
   comments to the preexisting code and used visuals to help figure out what process it accomplished all while using MIPS
   to step through the code's procedures. Soon, we discovered that the code we were given simply takes in an integer from
   the user and prints out a 1 if the number was odd and a 0 if the number is 0, 1, or even. Then, we translated the MIPS
   code to simple C++.

4. Our group relied heavily on verbally explaining the code and visually writing down the steps of the code to resolve this
   problem. Therefore, other than peer input from other group members and course materials such as the green card, we did
   not need to seek out other help.

5. The part of the code we were most pleased about was the revelation that not all numbers were going through the loop
   statements and there was a base case for one and zero.

6. The part of the code that frustrated us the most was using unnecessary loops to do the same task as a modulo statement
   and figuring out which registers were necessary and which could be ignored.
