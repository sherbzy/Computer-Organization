# Computer-Organization
This repository contains the projects from the Computer Organization course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Fall 2020. The README in each folder contains the project requirements and other necessary information.

Welcome to Computer Organization
We are going to make use of your programming skills to explore the simplest, yet most complex, of computer languages, assembly. Assembly is the bridge between software and hardware - the software/hardware interface - so it will show us how a CPU behaves, what compilers have to consider, and what memory-constrained devices have to deal with. These are critical skills in the current technological world of gaming, hacking, and big data.

Course Description
CSCI 341 covers the basic concepts of computer architecture and organization. Topics include machine level instructions and operating system calls used to write programs in assembly language, computer arithmetics, performance, processor design, and pipelining techniques. This course provides insight into the way computers operate at the machine level.

Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Recognize and manipulate numbers stored in digital computers
2. Utilize the MIPS instruction set to translate snippets of C programs to assembly and vice-versa
3. Describe the interface between the MIPS instruction set and hardware
4. Build a five-stage pipelined datapath from a single-cycle datapath to execute a selected set of MIPS instructions
5. Explain principle of locality and its relationship to memory hierarchy
6. Measure CPU performance from IC, CPI, and CC Time
