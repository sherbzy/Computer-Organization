1. Time Spent: about 4.5 hours

2. Approach: First, I had to write out comments in my code that outlined the steps I needed to take to write the problem.
    Then, it was just a matter of using my notes and the resources on canvas to go through the assignment one step at a
    time. I started with the .data that would be used to prompt the user and indicate which printed numbers meant what, and
    moved on to get an integer from input. Finally, I simply manipulated the input in different ways and printed the
    results. Also, I tested my code after each step and debug it to ensure that my logic was correct.
3. Help: The course material and the resources found at the beginning of module 2 were probably the biggest help throughout
    this project. However, I did need to use a "rubber-duck debug" method and explained my code several times to both a
    literal rubber duck and my roommates which also helped me catch a few mistakes with the logical shifts that I
    originally did not see.
4. Improvements: I do not know if it is possible yet with my limited understanding and knowledge of MIPS, but my code seems
    to be a bit repetitive when I am trying to find the different bytes to print. I was considering how I could write
    similar code in a language that I am familiar with, and I believe I could achieve the same results with less lines with
    the help of a loop. Also, I had hoped to have enough time to work on a few of the bonuses, but ended up 
5. Favorite part of Code: My favorite part of my code is where I used logical shifting to sort through the different bytes
    of the given integer. I am pleased that I was able to figure out the correct shifts in a relatively short amount of
    time.
