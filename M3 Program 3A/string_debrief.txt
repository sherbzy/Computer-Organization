1. Name: Lauren Sherburne
   Course: CSCI 341 - Computer Organization
   Homework: M3 Program 3A
   Date: October 22, 2020

2. Time Spent: 6 hours

3. I began by first writing the code that in main, since it was used to test my procedures, then by working on the
   procedures themselves. My main technique was to write small portions of code, then run tests to ensure it worked
   properly.

4. Beyond course material, I sought the help of a few fellow classmates who helped talk through some of my problems with
   me. They also were able to help me debug a few problems in one of my procedures.

5. I think my code could be more organized and could have more comments. If I had more time, I would make sure that it was
   more readable to peers.

6. I am most pleased with the fact that I actually was able to complete the assignment procedures as they seemed to be a 
   very daunting task when I first read the instruction.

7. Due to time restraints caused by a busy week, most of my testing involved using the example shown on Canvas: "hello,
   this is my string" followed by "5" and "1234". However, I tested a couple other strings and numbers just to double
   check that my code worked properly.
