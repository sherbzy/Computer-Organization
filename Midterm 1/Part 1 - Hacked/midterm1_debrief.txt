1. Group Name: Motyga Hackathon
   Members: Lauren Sherburne, Lucas King, Thomas Jensen
   Course: CSCI 341 - Computer Organization
   Midterm 1 - Part 1 - Hacked!
   Date: 10/5/20

2. Total Time: 3 hours

3. First, our group picked a basic procedure, the midpoint formula, to code in C++. We wrote pseudocode then C++ code with
   comments explain how the program takes in 2 points from the user before calculating and printing the midpoint. Our group
   decided that it would be best to first translate our C++ code to MIPS before making it more complicated so we created
   the MIPS equivalent of our midpoint procedure. One of the first ideas that we implemented to make our code more
   difficult to read is to change all of the register names to numbers (ex. $t0 = $8). Also, we added a separate function
   that does nothing to our actual output in order to further confuse readers.

4. For the most part, we used the course materials and peer input from group members to resolve any problems that arose.
   However, we did go to office hours to clarify if the instructions were asking for us to create a procedure/function 
   outside of main that was called one or more times inside of main. This helped us resolve some confusion as we were
   originally trying to perform all calculations inside of main.

5. Our group was a bit disappointed that we didn't have more time to work on making our code more difficult to read. If we
   had more time, we would have wanted to switch around our use of registers more and perhaps add more functions that in
   a sense did absolutely nothing other than add random values to the stack.

6. We are most pleased at how much we were able to mess with the syntax of our program to confuse any possible hackers.
