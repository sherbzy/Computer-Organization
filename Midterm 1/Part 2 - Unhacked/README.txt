Midterm 1 Part 2 - Unhacked

This is where your Part 2 work is submitted. See Part 1 description in Midterm 1 - Hackathon

This Midterm measures your internalization of MIPS and its hardware interface: computer arithmetic, architected binary interface, instruction set architecture. There is a lot of room in this for creativity and for scaling back; the best approach to take with Part 2 is to carefully walk through the code and determine what of it is "red herrings" (there to confuse you) and what of it is the actual intent of the program.

You will find the code you are to "un-hack", or disassemble, posted in an Announcement on your group's Canvas area - if you have announcements emailed to you, it will come directly to your inbox - at noon on Tuesday.

This part may take your team 1-4 hours to complete.

Note, late work is not accepted. Submit early if you are concerned, and re-submit up until the due time (Tuesday, 11:59 pm). Canvas will add -# markers to the file name, that is fine (-1 on the second submission, -2 on the third, and so on).

tl;dr
Your group makes 1 submission, so be clear about who is submitting
Your Part 2 will be provided to you by noon on Tuesday, in an announcement on your group's Canvas page.
Part 2 - decompile your assigned MIPS back to C++, submit MIPS (if modified), C++, and debrief here - due Tuesday, 11:59 pm Mountain Time
Do *not* to give the team that takes your hack-code any advice: if you were a hacker, you certainly wouldn't be helping them! 

Part 2
Note: Make reasonable assumptions where necessary and clearly state them.

You get to try to "break the hacker" in the second part of the midterm. 

If you run into something that feels like a brick wall with the code you are assigned, reach out to me or the TAs for advice, as the hackers won't be handing out advice.

You do have one advantage: you also did Part 1 - so you know what the constraints the hacker had in preparing their code to stump you, the white hat undoing what they've done.

Take the MIPS code you were given, and produce the C++ program that is equivalent to it. Again, as above, it need not be identical statement-for-statement, but should have the same arguments/return values, input/output, and behaviors.

Comment your C++ code: function comments should explain the function's result from its inputs, any inline comments to explain what the code is doing. Make your C++ code reasonably readable - we haven't been coding in C++, so use the style guidelines from CSCI 262 (but remember, no objects).

Your goal is to "catch" the hacker by figuring out what their code did - you need to decide what the overall objective of the code was (i.e., you should be able to say what its original purpose was, from the examples in part 1, for example, does it compute body-mass index, convert Kelvin to Fahrenheit, reverse a string, or what does it do?).

What to Submit for Part 2
Once you have created the equivalent C++ code, write a team Debrief, including how successful the group feels it was at determining the purpose of the original code. If you modified the MIPS code you were handed (added comments or otherwise), include that with your submission; otherwise include the original MIPS code that you started with. Combine the three files in a .zip/.tar/.7z file named CSCI341_Mid1_GroupName, and replace GroupName with your group's name. Submit that file here.

Part 2 is due by Tuesday11:59 pm MT.

I welcome your feedback on this method of assessment, how it went for you, and whether you felt it contributed to your overall knowledge in this class. Send that to me in a private Piazza message, via Canvas Inbox, or an email, or visit office hours to let me know.
